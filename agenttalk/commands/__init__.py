AgentTalk slash command source files.

These Markdown files define Claude Code slash commands under the /agenttalk: namespace.
agenttalk setup (Phase 6) copies them to ~/.claude/commands/agenttalk/ for global use.

Manual installation (development):
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands/agenttalk
    cp agenttalk/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/agenttalk/
