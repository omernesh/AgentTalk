# Plan 06-02: LICENSE File and README Documentation

## Goal

Write the MIT `LICENSE` file and a comprehensive `README.md` that fully satisfies DOC-01 through DOC-05. After this plan, the repository has complete user documentation covering installation, quickstart, all voices, all slash commands, tray menu usage, and a troubleshooting section.

## Requirements Covered

- DOC-01: README covers installation, quickstart, available voices, slash commands, tray menu usage
- DOC-02: README includes troubleshooting section (WASAPI exclusive mode, Kokoro download, Python version, hook verification)
- DOC-03: README is written to accommodate future feature additions (clear section structure)
- DOC-04: Repository includes MIT LICENSE file
- DOC-05: (Partially — README points to github.com/omern/AgentTalk; actual publish is Plan 06-03)

## Context

Key facts to include from accumulated project context:

**Python version:** Python 3.11 required. pystray crashes on 3.12+ due to GIL changes (STATE.md decision from Phase 1). This is the most important constraint to surface in docs.

**Audio:** WASAPI `auto_convert=True` is applied conditionally — only WASAPI devices, not MME. If a user has an MME device and hears errors, the troubleshooting section must cover this.

**Kokoro voices (af_ = American Female, am_ = American Male, bf_ = British Female, bm_ = British Male):**
- af_heart, af_bella, af_nicole, af_aoede, af_kore, af_sarah, af_sky
- am_adam, am_michael, am_echo, am_eric, am_fenrir, am_liam, am_onyx, am_puck, am_santa
- bf_emma, bf_isabella, bf_alice, bf_lily
- bm_george, bm_lewis, bm_daniel, bm_fable, bm_norton, bm_oscar

Default voice is `af_heart`.

**Slash commands (from agenttalk/commands/*.md written in Phase 5):**
- `/agenttalk:start` — launch service
- `/agenttalk:stop` — stop service
- `/agenttalk:voice [name]` — switch voice
- `/agenttalk:model [kokoro|piper]` — switch TTS engine

**Piper:** NOT a working feature in v1 (upstream archived Oct 2025 per STATE.md). DOC-03 says README is updated with every feature — so Piper is documented as "planned for v2".

**Model files:** NOT bundled in pip package — downloaded by `agenttalk setup` (~310MB total). This two-step process must be prominently documented.

**Hook verification command:** `cat ~/.claude/settings.json | python -m json.tool | grep -A3 agenttalk` (cross-platform alternative to `grep`)

<task id="06-02-T2" wave="1">
### Task 2: Create README.md

Create `D:/docker/claudetalk/README.md` with the full documentation.

The README must include these H2 sections in this order (per research DOC-01, DOC-02):

1. `## Installation`
2. `## Quickstart`
3. `## Available Voices`
4. `## Slash Commands`
5. `## Tray Menu`
6. `## Configuration`
7. `## Troubleshooting`
8. `## License`

**Exact content to write:**

```markdown
# AgentTalk

Real-time text-to-speech for Claude Code output — offline, local, no API keys.

Claude Code's responses are spoken aloud as they complete, hands-free, without leaving the terminal.

**Requires Python 3.11.** Python 3.12 and above are not supported (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 11
- Python 3.11 (exactly — see [Python version requirements](#python-version-requirements-311-only))
- A working audio output device

### Install and setup

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk
agenttalk setup
```

`agenttalk setup` will:
1. Download the Kokoro ONNX model files (~310 MB) to `%APPDATA%\AgentTalk\models\`
2. Register the `Stop` and `SessionStart` hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. Create an `AgentTalk.lnk` shortcut on your desktop

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install
pip install git+https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk

# 2. Download model and register hooks
agenttalk setup

# 3. Launch the service (or double-click the desktop shortcut)
pythonw agenttalk/service.py
```

Open Claude Code. The next Claude response will be spoken aloud automatically.

---

## Available Voices

Switch voices with `/agenttalk:voice [name]` or via the tray menu.

| Prefix | Region | Voices |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `af_` | American Female | `af_heart` (default), `af_bella`, `af_nicole`, `af_aoede`, `af_kore`, `af_sarah`, `af_sky` |
| `am_` | American Male | `am_adam`, `am_michael`, `am_echo`, `am_eric`, `am_fenrir`, `am_liam`, `am_onyx`, `am_puck`, `am_santa` |
| `bf_` | British Female | `bf_emma`, `bf_isabella`, `bf_alice`, `bf_lily` |
| `bm_` | British Male | `bm_george`, `bm_lewis`, `bm_daniel`, `bm_fable`, `bm_norton`, `bm_oscar` |

The default voice is `af_heart`.

---

## Slash Commands

Run these from the Claude Code terminal (type the command as your message):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/agenttalk:start` | Launch the AgentTalk service if it is not running |
| `/agenttalk:stop` | Stop the service and silence any playing audio |
| `/agenttalk:voice [name]` | Switch the active voice (e.g., `/agenttalk:voice af_bella`) |
| `/agenttalk:model [kokoro\|piper]` | Switch the TTS engine (`kokoro` is the only working engine in v1) |

Voice and model changes take effect immediately for the next utterance and persist across restarts.

---

## Tray Menu

Right-click the AgentTalk icon in the Windows system tray to access:

- **Mute / Unmute** — toggle TTS on and off (checkmark shows current state)
- **Voice** — submenu listing all available Kokoro voices; click to switch
- **Quit** — stop the service and remove the tray icon

The tray icon changes appearance while TTS is actively speaking and returns to default when playback finishes.

---

## Configuration

Settings are persisted in `%APPDATA%\AgentTalk\config.json`. All settings can be changed at runtime without restarting the service.

| Setting | Default | How to change |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `voice` | `af_heart` | `/agenttalk:voice [name]` or tray menu |
| `speed` | `1.0` | POST to `/config` with `{"speed": 1.2}` |
| `volume` | `1.0` | POST to `/config` with `{"volume": 0.8}` |
| `model` | `kokoro` | `/agenttalk:model [kokoro\|piper]` |
| `muted` | `false` | Tray Mute toggle |
| `pre_cue_path` | `null` | POST to `/config` with `{"pre_cue_path": "C:\\path\\bell.wav"}` |
| `post_cue_path` | `null` | POST to `/config` with `{"post_cue_path": "C:\\path\\bell.wav"}` |

## Troubleshooting

### WASAPI exclusive mode conflicts

**Symptom:** No audio plays, or you see `PaErrorCode -9984` in the log.

**Cause:** Some audio devices use WASAPI in exclusive mode, which blocks other applications from using the audio device simultaneously.

**Fix options:**
1. In Windows Sound Settings, set your default output device to use "Shared" mode (not "Exclusive").
2. Use an MME audio device instead of WASAPI — MME handles sample rate resampling automatically.
3. If you have multiple audio devices, switch to one that uses WASAPI in shared mode.

Check `%APPDATA%\AgentTalk\agenttalk.log` for the detected host API type:
```
Non-WASAPI device (MME) — using PortAudio default resampling.
```
or
```
WASAPI device detected — auto_convert enabled.
```

### Kokoro model download issues

**Symptom:** `agenttalk setup` fails with an HTTP error or download stalls.

**Fix options:**
1. Check your internet connection and firewall settings — the download requires access to `github.com`.
2. Ensure you have at least 400 MB of free disk space in `%APPDATA%`.
3. If you see HTTP 404, the model URL may have changed — check the latest release at [thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx releases](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases) and update the URL in `agenttalk/installer.py`.
4. Re-run `agenttalk setup` — downloads are idempotent (partially downloaded files are skipped and re-downloaded from scratch on retry).

**Partial download recovery:** If a download was interrupted, delete the incomplete file from `%APPDATA%\AgentTalk\models\` before re-running setup.

### Python version requirements (3.11 only)

**Symptom:** The service crashes immediately, or you see a GIL-related error on startup, or `pystray` fails to import.

**Cause:** Python 3.12 introduced changes to the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) that cause `pystray` to crash when the tray icon runs on the main thread. This is a known upstream issue with no fix released as of February 2026.

**Fix:** Install Python 3.11 and use it for AgentTalk.

Check your Python version:
```bash
python --version
# Must show: Python 3.11.x
```

Install Python 3.11 from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3118/) and re-install AgentTalk in a Python 3.11 virtual environment:
```bash
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install git+https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk
agenttalk setup
```

### Hook registration verification

**Symptom:** Claude Code responses are not being spoken — the service is running but hooks do not fire.

**Verify hooks are registered:**
```bash
python -m json.tool %USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json
```

Look for `"agenttalk"` entries under `"hooks"` > `"Stop"` and `"hooks"` > `"SessionStart"`.

**Fix:** Re-run `agenttalk setup` to re-register the hooks. The registration is idempotent and will not duplicate existing entries.

**Verify the hook paths are correct:** The hook command must point to the pythonw.exe in your current Python environment. If you have reinstalled AgentTalk into a different venv, re-run `agenttalk setup` to update the paths.

**Verify async hooks:** Both hooks must have `"async": true` to avoid blocking Claude Code's UI. This is set automatically by `agenttalk setup`.

## License

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).
```

**Important formatting notes:**
- The code blocks inside the README content use triple backticks — when writing to file, these must be actual backtick characters in the markdown
- Tables use pipe characters for columns
- Backslashes in Windows paths must be escaped in the markdown table cells (use `\\` to display as `\`)
</task>

## Verification

After all tasks complete, verify:

1. `LICENSE` exists at `D:/docker/claudetalk/LICENSE` and contains "MIT License" and "Copyright (c) 2026 omern"
2. `README.md` exists at `D:/docker/claudetalk/README.md`
3. `README.md` contains all required H2 sections: `## Installation`, `## Quickstart`, `## Available Voices`, `## Slash Commands`, `## Tray Menu`, `## Configuration`, `## Troubleshooting`, `## License`
4. `README.md` troubleshooting section contains all four required topics: WASAPI, Kokoro download, Python version, hook verification
5. `README.md` mentions `>=3.11,<3.12` or "Python 3.11 only" prominently
6. `README.md` shows the two-step install: `pip install` then `agenttalk setup`
7. Run: `python -c "txt=open('README.md').read(); assert '## Troubleshooting' in txt; assert 'af_heart' in txt; assert '/agenttalk:start' in txt; print('README OK')"` from `D:/docker/claudetalk/` — must print `README OK`

## must_haves

Goal-backward from "README covers all required topics and LICENSE exists":

- [ ] `LICENSE` file exists with MIT license text and "Copyright (c) 2026 omern" (DOC-04)
- [ ] `README.md` has `## Installation` section showing `pip install git+https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk` then `agenttalk setup` as two separate commands (DOC-01 — two-step install must be explicit)
- [ ] `README.md` has `## Quickstart` section with 3 commands (DOC-01)
- [ ] `README.md` has `## Available Voices` section with full Kokoro voice list (DOC-01)
- [ ] `README.md` has `## Slash Commands` section covering all four commands (DOC-01)
- [ ] `README.md` has `## Tray Menu` section covering mute, voice submenu, quit (DOC-01)
- [ ] `README.md` has `## Troubleshooting` section covering all four required topics: WASAPI exclusive mode, Kokoro download, Python 3.11 requirement, hook verification (DOC-02)
- [ ] `README.md` prominently states Python 3.11 is required and 3.12+ is not supported (critical user-facing constraint from STATE.md)
- [ ] `README.md` does NOT claim Piper is a working v1 feature (Piper upstream archived Oct 2025 — must note as planned v2)
- [ ] `README.md` uses named H2 sections (`## Installation`, `## Quickstart`, `## Available Voices`, `## Slash Commands`, `## Tray Menu`, `## Configuration`, `## Troubleshooting`, `## License`) that allow future features to be inserted as new H2 sections without restructuring existing content (DOC-03)
