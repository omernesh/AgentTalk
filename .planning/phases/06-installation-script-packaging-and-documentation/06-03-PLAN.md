# Plan 06-03: GitHub Repository Publish

## Goal

Make the AgentTalk repository publicly accessible at `github.com/omern/AgentTalk` under the MIT license. After this plan, any user can run `pip install git+https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk` to install the package.

## Requirements Covered

- DOC-05: Repository is published publicly at github.com/omern/AgentTalk under the MIT license

## Context

This plan depends on 06-01 (pyproject.toml + CLI + installer) and 06-02 (README.md + LICENSE) being complete — the repository must have those files before being published.

The `gh` CLI is available on this machine (confirmed via project toolchain). Two scenarios:
1. The remote `origin` is already set to `github.com/omern/AgentTalk` — run `gh repo edit --visibility public`
2. The remote does not exist or points elsewhere — run `gh repo create omern/AgentTalk --public --source=. --remote=origin --push`

Before publishing, commit all Phase 6 files (pyproject.toml, agenttalk/cli.py, agenttalk/installer.py, README.md, LICENSE, updated requirements.txt).

## Tasks

<task id="06-03-T1" wave="1">
### Task 1: Stage and commit all Phase 6 files

Stage and commit all files created or modified in Plans 06-01 and 06-02.

Run from `D:/docker/claudetalk/`:

```bash
git add pyproject.toml agenttalk/cli.py agenttalk/installer.py requirements.txt README.md LICENSE
git status
```

Verify that exactly these files appear in the staged area:
- `pyproject.toml` (new)
- `agenttalk/cli.py` (new)
- `agenttalk/installer.py` (new)
- `requirements.txt` (modified)
- `README.md` (new)
- `LICENSE` (new)

Then commit:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add packaging, CLI entry point, installer, README, and LICENSE for v1.0 release"
```

If there are additional untracked or modified files that should NOT be committed (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.env`, large binary files), do not add them. Use specific file names in `git add`, not `git add .` or `git add -A`.
</task>

<task id="06-03-T2" wave="2">
### Task 2: Check remote origin and publish repository

First, check whether a remote origin is already configured:

```bash
git remote -v
```

**Scenario A: Remote `origin` already points to `github.com/omern/AgentTalk`**

Check current visibility:
```bash
gh repo view omern/AgentTalk --json visibility -q .visibility
```

If the result is `PRIVATE`, make it public:
```bash
gh repo edit omern/AgentTalk --visibility public
```

If the result is already `PUBLIC`, skip — nothing to do.

Then push the commit from Task 1:
```bash
git push origin master
```

**Scenario B: No remote origin configured, or origin points to a different repo**

Create the repository and push in one command:
```bash
gh repo create omern/AgentTalk --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

This command:
- Creates `github.com/omern/AgentTalk` as a public repository
- Sets `origin` to the new repo URL
- Pushes the current branch

**After either scenario, verify:**
```bash
gh repo view omern/AgentTalk --json visibility,url -q '"URL: \(.url) — Visibility: \(.visibility)"'
```

Expected output: `URL: https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk — Visibility: PUBLIC`

**Then verify pip install works from the public URL:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk --dry-run
```

A successful `--dry-run` confirms the package is installable without actually installing it.
</task>

## Verification

After all tasks complete, verify:

1. `git log --oneline -3` shows the Phase 6 commit as the most recent commit
2. `gh repo view omern/AgentTalk --json visibility -q .visibility` returns `PUBLIC`
3. `pip install git+https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk --dry-run` completes without error
4. The repository URL `https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk` is accessible (not 404)

## must_haves

Goal-backward from "repository publicly accessible at github.com/omern/AgentTalk under MIT license":

- [ ] All Phase 6 files (pyproject.toml, agenttalk/cli.py, agenttalk/installer.py, README.md, LICENSE, requirements.txt) are committed before publishing (repo must be complete before going public)
- [ ] Repository visibility is PUBLIC — not private, not internal (DOC-05 requires public access)
- [ ] `pip install git+https://github.com/omern/AgentTalk --dry-run` succeeds — package is pip-installable from the public URL (INST-01 end-to-end verification)
- [ ] LICENSE file is present in the published repository (DOC-04 — MIT license must be in the repo, not just referenced)
